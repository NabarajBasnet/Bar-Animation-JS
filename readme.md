# Bar Animation in JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple bar animation where bars increase in height over time. The purpose of this project is to practice and master the fundamentals of JavaScript, focusing on animations, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features
- Dynamic creation of bars on an HTML canvas or within a container.
- Smooth animation where bar heights grow incrementally over time in random time.
- Customizable animation speed and bar properties (e.g., color, width, spacing).

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage and canvas/container for the animation.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the page and animation aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the animation and DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).
- A modern web browser to run and test the animation.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NabarajBasnet/Bar-Animation-JS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Bar-Animation-JS
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the animation in action.

### Usage
1. Modify the `script.js` file to customize the animation speed, bar properties, or interactivity.
2. Reload the `index.html` in your browser to view your changes.

## How It Works
- **Initialization**: The JavaScript file initializes the bars and sets up an animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval`.
- **Animation Loop**: Bar heights are incremented at each frame or interval until they reach a maximum height.
- **Customization**: Parameters like bar count, animation speed, and colors can be adjusted in the JavaScript code.

## Customization Ideas
- Add buttons to start, pause, and reset the animation.
- Use gradients or patterns for the bar fills.
- Make the bar animation responsive to user input (e.g., click, hover, or keyboard).
